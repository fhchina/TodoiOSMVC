TodoiOSMVC
==========

Really simple example of using Core Data and typical MVC patterns to create a Todo list for iPhone using iOS 7 SDK.

Developed as a boilerplate for my ["Producing an App from Start to Finish in 2 Days"](http://www.cyfle.co.uk/shortCoursesDetails/producing-an-app) course to be delivered in November.
